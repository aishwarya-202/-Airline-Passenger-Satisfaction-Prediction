The  aim of this project is to showcase a few of the basics of data science (data cleaning, encoding, feature engineering, and model building and training), all while attempting to solve a problem that is common among businesses to satisfy the customerâ€™s expectation.

We will be treating this as a binary classification problem, where we will attempt to create a model that predicts whether a customer was Satisfied or Unsatisfied with the experience and/or service which an airline provided.
